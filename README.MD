# Fall into Pit

Fall into Pit is a simple little game that I've been working on for the past couple of weeks. The reason why I'm working on 
this project instead of working on DSGE is because something felt off when working on. I decided to work on a small game project
to understand what I was missing and I think I figured it out. I wasn't working on game along side of DSGE which was my issue. 
This is why this project exists. The goal is to get this game finished and take its source code and reporpose it for another game and keep doing it until I have a general purpose game engine... Maybe. Who knows!

So what is "Fall into Pit?" Basically its a little game were you are falling into a bit and you'll have to dodge spikes to survive, collect coins to get a better score, and collect hearts to keep yourself alive. Thats pretty much the basic gameplay
loop.
